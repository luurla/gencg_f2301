## Drawing Machines

Today's challenge was to create a drawing machine. Initially, I interpreted it as a code-based paint tool where we could draw with the mouse or something similar. However, I soon realized that the concept of a drawing machine went beyond a simple "paint function."

So, I attempted to create abstract random figures so that each time it would change its form.

## End Feelings of the Day:
In the end, I think I mixed the initial concept with the task at hand.
