# Day 02

## Iterative Patterns

I started by creating lines, but somehow my idea shifted to eyes.

I experimented a lot but encountered problems with the rotation.
Here are some nice failures:

 <img src="content/day01/DAY2/fail2.png" alt="drawing" width="33%"/>
  <img src="content/day01/DAY2/fail3.png" alt="drawing" width="33%"/>

### A variation as a GIF:

<img src="content/day01/DAY2/EW3-min.gif" alt="drawing" width="63%"/>

### The end result:

{% endraw %}


## End Feelings of the Day:

I had some difficulties creating the initial idea, but I'm very happy with how it turned out in the end.
